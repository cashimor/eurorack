The Pick and Place, Gerber and BOM files are for version 0, which has two errors:
* R3 needs to be removed, and a 1k resistor needs to be put between the top pad of R3 to the top part of the trim potentiometer
* A 100nF capacitor needs to be added from the middle of the glide potentiometer to ground (best is to use the jack ground)
