This is a Decay module, with an input and output and a knob that can control it, and a ADSR module with controls for Attack, Decay/Release (same) and Sustain.
The Sustain can only be controlled through a jack, although it does have a trimpot at the back to set the default. The others can be controlled by jack or by
know, where the knob can attentuate the jack as well.
