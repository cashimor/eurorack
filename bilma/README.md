Bilma is a Raspberry Pi pico based drum module. It features 8 local sets, and 4 sample based sets. It has a dial
to select the kit, and a dial to change the output filter, which for some reason has some overdrive. The python
file works, but the gerber files and schematic have not been tested.

The original code was by @todbot, but by now it has been heavily modified.
